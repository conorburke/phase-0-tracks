What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
  -HTML5 semantic tags serve to give meaning to the content of those elements.  They do not exist to give structure to the page or make that content look a certain way on the page.  For example, a header could technically be displayed at the bottom of the page; it does not automatically go to the top of the page.  Rather, the information in the header tag could be a logo, overview, or possibly nav buttons.  They also serve to help the developer and other developers know what type of information is contained in those elements.
  -I don't necessarily see any tags as the most useful, as certain tags will certainly be very common such as nav and header, while others serve a very distinct purpose such as aside.
What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
  -The order the browser loads information depends on many factors but seems to have a consistent process.  The elements will be "parsed" into a tree of nodes.  This is in accordance with the Document Object Model, and it seems that the major elements will be loaded with their encompassed elements following in trace.  This is also done in accordance with any CSS effects so that the layout of the page can be accurately depicted.  Once the layout is complete with all the elements, the process of visually depicting those elements is enacted until the page is loaded.
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
  -I learned how to create snippets in Sublime, as well as some other quick keyboard shortcuts.  In the future I'll create snippets on an ad hoc basis.  Basically, if I am designing a project in which several pages will have a similar format (i.e. several 8x8 tables) then I would create a snippet to save time.  Otherwise I may not use it enough to bother creating it.
What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
  -I still need to learn a lot more about the semantic elements of HTML5.  Repetition will be useful in using these tags to add meaning to the content of the pages I create.  I think I mostly understand the definition and purpose of semantic tags, but I need to do more reading and practice before I could readily teach someone else about it.
