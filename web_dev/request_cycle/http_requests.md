## What are some common HTTP status codes?
> Some common HTTP status codes include 200 (OK), 300 (Multiple Choices), 400 (Bad Request), 404 (Not Found) 500 (Internal Service Error), and 100 (Continue).

## What is the difference between a GET request and a POST request? When might each be used?
>The basic difference between GET and POST is that GET is used to simply ask for information to load onto the page, while POST sends data as a submission.  GET is used to load basic web pages such as news sites, while POST is used to submit info on forms and send passwords since it is more discreet.  Because the info isn't changed with GET, it can and often is cached on the local machine.


## Optional bonus question: What is a cookie (the technical kind, not the delicious kind)? How does it relate to HTTP requests?
> A cookie is information (in the form of plain text) that is stored in a web browser and communicates the state of the browser to the server.  Cookies are used to let a server know that the user is logged in, for example.  It also keeps track of thing such as preferences and activities (i.e. items in a shopping cart).  They are useful because a server cannot remember everyone's info, so these files "remind" the server of a user's state.
