## What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

>Some of the major design philosophies of Linux include open source development, freedom and functionality, and power to the users.  Linux is an open source OS and is thus open to the public; this spurs all types of modifications and innovation.  Users are able to use the software for many purposes, and are encouraged to use and create programs that are very portable.  And Linux assumes the user is competent and knows what they are doing.  This allows users of Linux systems to operate with fewer restrictions, which can be freeing but also dangerous if not used smartly.


## In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

>A VPS is a remote computer that you have access to via some hosting company.  You can use this to do many things, such as host a website or simply store files.  The advantages of a VPS include the cost effectiveness (can run a website for a few dollars a month vs buying and maintaining a server rack) and scalability (can increase or decrease size as necessary).  Also, it gives you the ability to be the root user, which you may not have if you are using a shared hosting service.


## Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

>If you run as the root user there is no safety net if you make a mistake.  If you make a mistake or there is some security mishap, the consequences can destroy the entire system.  However, if you delegate tasks down to the user level that at least siphons off some back corridors that malicious code might try to infiltrate.  The root user has all permissions, which usually should not be used except for some administrative tasks.  Users usually have the permissions they need and do not need (nor should have) total system control.
