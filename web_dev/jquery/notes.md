## Learn JQuery plan
1. Watch YouTube video that touches on basics of JQuery
2. Find popular sources on JQuery (W3 schools, MDN)
3. Consult book I just bought (Javascript and JQuery by Jon Duckett)
4. Use Codecademy to practice

> This is how I normally like to learn things.  I try to get a broad picture of how the technology works and is implemented, and then find some premier and quick resources for it.  I then like to read about it in depth and hopefully practice along with.  Codecademy is a great resource for learning and practicing new languages and libraries.  Breaks are not important for a 2 hour learning exercise, but if I go longer it would be good to give my mind a break.


## Time up

After about two hours I was able to understand how to install or link jQuery to my local machine and link it with an HTML document.  I was also able to manipulate a simple HTML file with some animation.  It was actually a lot of fun.  I found a really helpful YouTube series by DevTips that showed jQuery startup and many of the commands.  It also linked me to the jQuery site (such as api.jquery.com).  I also referenced jQuery on Codecademy.  Now that I have a foundational knowledge and can understand what the big picture is, it is time to get into the weeds and read the jQuery book I have.
