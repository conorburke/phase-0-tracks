## Learn JQuery plan
1. Watch YouTube video that touches on basics of JQuery
2. Find popular sources on JQuery (W3 schools, MDN)
3. Consult book I just bought (Javascript and JQuery by Jon Duckett)
4. Use Codecademy to practice

> This is how I normally like to learn things.  I try to get a broad picture of how the technology works and is implemented, and then find some premier and quick resources for it.  I then like to read about it in depth and hopefully practice along with.  Codecademy is a great resource for learning and practicing new languages and libraries.  Breaks are not important for a 2 hour learning exercise, but if I go longer it would be good to give my mind a break.
